## 📖 About the project

This project was developed on the Next Level Week #02 event by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) 🚀

This application is designed to connect teachers and students. For teachers, it is possible to define the start and end time of classes, the hourly price and describe themselves. Studens can get in touch and choose favorites teachers.

## 📈 My improvements

  - Use of design patterns Generic Repository, Unit of Work, Factory and Services
- List of Subjects
  - I removed a list of subjects that was fixed in the html in two different places, storing it in the database.
- Teacher Search Filters
  - Now if the user does not fill any option in the filter, all teachers available will be listed.
  - Possibility of conducting a search by filling in only 1 or all fields.
- CSS Effects
  - Transition effects added between the pages.
  - Transition effects added on pseudo elements of the buttons that have focus.
